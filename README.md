# calculator-win10
<b>My own replica of the stock Windows 10 Calculator app. </b>
<br>The features done by 20.11.16 include:
Standard version:
Input via number buttons 
Different erase and clear buttons 
Single operator math functions
Multi operator math functions

Features yet to be made:
Continious input (e.g. after square root, the addition fails to work => needs fixing)
Using dot button
Using negate (+/-) button
Using memory buttons to store variable (worked before, but I broke it)
Setting flyout menu
Storing settings into separate file

Testing and refactoring shoudld be made after every major build
