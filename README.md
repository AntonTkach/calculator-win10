# calculator-win10
<b>My own replica of the stock Windows 10 Calculator app. </b>
<br>The features done by 20.11.16 include:
<br>Standard version:
<br>Input via number buttons 
<br>Different erase and clear buttons 
<br>Single operator math functions
<br>Multi operator math functions

<br>Features yet to be made:
<br>Continious input (e.g. after square root, the addition fails to work => needs fixing)
<br>Coosing another operator during input
<br>Using dot button
<br>Using negate (+/-) button
<br>Using memory buttons to store variable (worked before, but I broke it)
<br>Setting flyout menu
<br>Storing settings into separate file

Testing and refactoring shoudld be made after every major build
